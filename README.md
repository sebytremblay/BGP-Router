# CS3700-P3-BGP-Router

## Overall steps taken
### Repo Initialization & Project Setup
First, I imported the starter code from the repo. The starter code includes an implementation of a router which simply connects to its peers, sends a handshake message, and prints out every other message it receives.

The starter code includes config files which demonstrate various situations that the router must be able to handle. To test this we use a similar implemented in the [run] script. This can be used as follows:

### `$./run [config-file-path]`
